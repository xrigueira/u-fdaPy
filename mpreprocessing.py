"""This file performs the multivariate preprocessing. In order to be able
to compare each variable and validate the outleirs we need to make sure that
each variable has the same lenght. This is not a critical contidion in the
univariate analysis. For that reason, if I want to compare the relation
between different variables I have to preprocess them together making sure
those time frames with too many gaps will be eliminated in all variables and not
just one (which is the univariate case). This way we ensure equality of length 
for each variable, what makes the comparable."""
